Hi. This is a very basic web app the consumes Openweather API. 

This will display your city`s temperature an real-feel in celsius degrees, as Openweather broadcasts both in Kelvin by default. You should pass API_KEY, LAT and LON as environment variables.

#1 Clone the repo.
#2 Run npm i
#3 The app only serves the "/weather" endpoint.
