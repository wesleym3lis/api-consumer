Hi. This is a very basic web app the consumes Openweather API. 

This will display your city`s temperature an real-feel in celsius degrees, as Openweather broadcasts both in Kelvin by default. You should pass API_KEY, LAT and LON as environment variables. Check the .env-example file.

#1 Clone the repo.
#2 This documentation assumes you already have a Openweather API key. If you do, access https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and add it to your environment variables.
#3 Run npm i
#4 The app only serves the "/weather" endpoint.
